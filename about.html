                <p class="aboutho">
                    I’m Kamal Bohara, deeply passionate about the tech field.
                    From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by programming and technology,
                    constantly exploring new ideas and challenges. I’m committed to improving
                    my skills and staying updated with the latest trends, always eager to
                    create and innovate in the world of technology. <br><br>
                     
                    As I continue to grow, I find myself drawn to areas like artificial intelligence,
                     cybersecurity, and software development.I spend my free time learning new coding 
                     techniques, watching tutorials, and working on small projects that challenge my 
                     thinking. Reading tech blogs and staying informed about the latest innovations 
                     fuels my curiosity. I also enjoy collaborating with others, sharing knowledge, 
                      and participating in coding forums. These experiences not only sharpen my technical 
                      skills but also help me develop communication and teamwork abilities. My goal is to
                       become a skilled software engineer who can contribute to impactful and innovative 
                       solutions that make life easier and more efficient for people around the world. <br> <br>
                      
                       I plan to pursue a degree in computer science  
                       and expand my knowledge through research and hands-on experience.  
                       One day, I hope to launch my own tech startup  
                       to turn creative ideas into impactful products.  

                       I'm also passionate about mentoring young students  
                       and inspiring them to explore the world of technology.  
                       With hard work, creativity, and purpose,  
                       I aim to make a meaningful difference in tech and beyond.
